Abstract

  Lua is an embedded programming language designed to be used as a conguration language for any program that needs one. This document describes the Lua programming language and the API that allows interaction between Lua programs and its host C program. It also presents some examples of using the main features of the system.

1 Introduction

Lua is an embedded programming language designed to support general procedural programming features with data description facilities. It is supposed to be used as a conguration language for any program that needs one. Lua was designed by R. Ierusalimschy, L. H. de Figueiredo and W. Celes, and implemented by W. Celes.
  Lua is implemented as a library, written in C. Being an embedded language, Lua has no notion of a "main" program: it only works embedded in a host client, called the embedding program. This host program can invoke functions to execute a piece of code in Lua, can write and read Lua variables, and can register C functions to be called by Lua code. Through the use of C functions, Lua can be augmented to cope with rather dierent domains, thus creating customized programming languages sharing a syntactical framework.
  Lua is free distribution software, and provided as usual with no guarantees. The implementation described in this manual is available by anonymous ftp from
  
  ftp.icad.puc-rio.br:/pub/lua/lua_1.0.tar.Z

2 Environment and Modules

  All statements in Lua are executed in a global environment. This environment, which keeps all global variables and functions, is initialized at the beginning of the embedding program and persists until its end.
  The global environment can be manipulated by Lua code or by the embedding program, which can read and write global variables using functions in the library that implements Lua.
  Global variables do not need declaration. Any variable is assumed to be global unless explicitly declared local (see local declarations, Section 4.4.5). Before the first assignment, the
value of a global variable is **nil**.
  The unit of execution of Lua is called a module. The syntax for modules is:<1> 
  
  module -> {statement | function}

  A module may contain statements and/or function definitions, and may be in a file or in a string inside the host program. When a module is executed, first all its functions and statements are compiled, and the functions added to the global environment; then the statements are executed in sequential order. All modifications a module effects on the global environment persist after its end. Those include modifications to global variables and definitions of new functions <2>.  


3 Types

Lua is a dynamically typed language. Variables do not have types; only values do. All values carry their own type. Therefore, there are no type definitions in the language.
  There are seven basic types in Lua: nil, number, string, function, Cfunction, userdata, and table. Nil is the type of the value **nil**, whose main property is to be different from any other value. Number represents real (floating point) numbers, while string has the usual meaning.
  Functions are considered first-class values in Lua. This means that functions can be stored in variables, passed as arguments to other functions and returned as results. When a function in Lua is defined, its body is compiled and stored in a global variable with the given name.

1 As usual in extended BNF, {a} means 0 or more a's, [a] means an optional a and {a}+ means one or more a's.
2 Actually, a function definition is an assignment to a global variable; see Section 3.

Lua can call (and manipulate) functions written in Lua and functions written in C; the latter have type Cfunction.
  The type userdata is provided to allow arbitrary C pointers to be stored in Lua variables. It corresponds to void* and has no valid operations in Lua, besides assignment and equality test.
  The type table implements associative arrays, that is, arrays that can be indexed both with numbers and with strings. Therefore, this type may be used not only to represent ordinary arrays, but also symbol tables, sets, records, etc. To represent a record, Lua uses the field name as an index. The language supports this representation by providing a.name as syntactic sugar for a["name"].
  It is important to notice that tables are ob jects, and not values. Variables cannot contain tables, only references to them. Assignment, parameter passing and returns always manipulate references to tables, and do not imply any kind of copy. Moreover, tables must be explicitly created before used; see Section 4.5.7.

4 The Language

This section describes the lexis, syntax and semantics of Lua.

4.1 Lexical Conventions

Lua is a case sensitive language. Identifiers can be any string of letters, digits, and underscores, not beginning with a digit. The following words are reserved, and cannot be used as identifiers: 

    and do else elseif end
    function if local nil not
    or repeat return until then while

  The following strings denote other tokens:

    ~= <= >= < > = .. + - * / %
    ( ) { } [ ] @ ; , .

Literal strings can be delimited by matching single or double quotes, and can contain the C-like escape sequences '\n', '\t' and '\r'. Comments start anywhere outside a string with a double hyphen (--) and run until the end of the line.
  Numerical constants may be written with an optional decimal part, and an optional decimal exponent. Examples of valid numerical constants are:
    
    4 4. .4 4.57e-3 .3e12

4.2 Coercion

Lua provides some automatic conversions. Any arithmetic operation applied to a string tries to convert that string to a number, following the usual rules. More specifically, the string is converted to a number using the standard strtod C function. Conversely, whenever a number is used when a string is expected, that number is converted to a string, according to the following rule: if the number is an integer, it is written without exponent or decimal point; otherwise, it is formatted following the "%g" conversion specification of the standard printf C function.

4.3 Adjustment

Functions in Lua can return many values. Because there are no type declarations, the system does not know how many values a function will return. Therefore, sometimes, a list of values must be adjusted , at run time, to a given length. If there are more values than are needed, the last values are thrown away. If there are more needs than values, the list is extended with as many **nil's** as needed. Adjustment also occurs in other contexts, such as multiple assignment.

4.4 Statements

Lua supports an almost conventional set of statements. The conventional commands include assignment, control structures and procedure calls. Non-conventional commands include table constructors, explained in Section 4.5.7, and local variable declarations.

4.4.1 Blocks

A block is a list of statements, executed sequentially. Any statement can be optionally followed by a semicolon.

    block -> {stat sc} [ret sc]
    sc -> [';']

For syntactic reasons, a return statement can only be written as the last statement of a block. This restriction also avoids some "statement not reached" errors.

4.4.2 Assignment

The language allows multiple assignment. Therefore, the syntax defines a list of variables on the left side, and a list of expressions on the right side. Both lists have their elements separated by commas.

    stat -> varlist1 '=' explist1
    varlist1 -> var {',' var}

This statement first evaluates all values on the right side and eventual indices on the left side, and then makes the assignments. Therefore, it can be used to exchange two values, as in

    x, y = y, x

Before the assignment, the list of values is adjusted to the length of the list of variables (see
Section 4.3).
  A single name can denote a global or a local variable.

    var -> name
    var -> var '[' exp1 ']' | var '.' name

  Brackets are used to index a table. In this case, var must result in a table value; otherwise, there is an execution error. The syntax var.NAME is just syntactic sugar for var["NAME"].

4.4.3 Control Structures

The condition expression of a control structure can return any value. All values different from **nil** are considered true, while **nil** is considered false. Ifs, whiles and repeats have the usual meaning.

	stat -> while exp1 do block end
	stat -> rep eat block until exp1
	stat -> if exp1 then block {elseif} [else block] end
	elseif -> elseif exp1 then block

  A return is used to return values from a function. Because a function may return more than one value, the syntax for a return statement is:
	
	ret -> return explist

4.4.4 Expressions as Statements

All expressions with p ossible side-effects can b e executed as statements. These include function calls and table constructors:

	stat -> functioncall
	stat -> tableconstructor

  Eventual returned values are thrown away. Function calls are explained in Section 4.5.8, while constructors are the sub ject of Section 4.5.7.

4.4.5 Lo cal Declarations

Local variables can b e declared anywhere inside a blo ck. Their scop e b egins after the declaration and lasts until the blo ck end. The declaration may include an initial assignment:

	stat -> local declist [init]
	declist -> name {',' name}
	init -> '=' explist1

If there is an initial assignment, it has the same semantics of a multiple assignment. Otherwise,
all variables are initialized with nil.

4.5 Expressions

4.5.1 Simple Expressions

Simple expressions are:

	exp -> '(' exp ')'
	exp -> nil
	exp -> 'number'
	exp -> 'literal'
	exp -> var

Numbers (numerical constants) and string literals are explained in Section 4.1. Variables are explained in Section 4.4.2.

4.5.2 Arithmetic Op erators

Lua supp orts the usual arithmetic operators, with the usual meaning. These op erators are the binary +, -, * and /, and the unary + and -. The operands must be numbers, or strings that can be converted to numbers, according to the rules given in Section 4.2.


4.5.3 Relational Op erators

Lua offers the following relational op erators:

	< > <= >= ~= =

All return **nil** as false and 1 as true.

  Equality first compares the typ es of its op erands. If they are different, the result is nil. Otherwise, their values are compared. Numbers and strings are compared in the usual way. Tables, Cfunctions, and functions are compared by reference, that is, two tables are considered equal only if they are the same table. The op erator ~= is exactly the negation of equality (=).
  The other op erators can only b e applied to strings and numbers. If one of the arguments is a string, the other is converted to a string, and their values are compared using lexicographical order. Otherwise, b oth are numb ers and are compared as such.

4.5.4 Logical Op erators

All logical op erators, like control structures, consider nil as false and anything else as true. Like relational op erators, they return nil as false and 1 as true. The logical op erators are:

	and or not

The operators and and or use short-cut evaluation, that is, the second op erand is evaluated only if necessary.

4.5.5 Concatenation

Lua offers a string concatenation op erator, denoted by "..". The op erands must b e strings or numbers, which are converted to strings according to the rules in Section 4.2.

4.5.6 Precedence

Op erator precedence follows the table b elow, from the lower to the higher priority:

	and or
	< > <= >= ~= =
	..
	+ -
	* /
	not + (unary) - (unary)

All binary op erators are left asso ciative.

4.5.7 Table Constructors

Table constructors are expressions that create tables. Table constructors are ffered in different flavors. The simplest one is:

	tableconstructor ! '@' '(' [exp1 ] ')'

  Such an expression results in a new empty table. An optional dimension may b e given as a hint to the initial table size. Indep endently of the initial dimension, all arrays in Lua stretch dynamically as needed.
  To construct a table and initialize some fields, the following syntax is available:

	tableconstructor -> '@' [name] field list

  Such an expression creates a new table, which will b e its final value, initialize some of its fields according to fieldlist (see b elow), and, if name is given, calls a function with that name passing the table as parameter. This function can b e used to check field values, to create default fields, or for any other side-effect.

	field list -> 'f' [field list1 ] 'g'
	field list1 -> field {',' field}
	field -> name '=' exp

This field list initializes named fields in a table. As an example:

	a = @f{x = 1, y = 3}

is equivalent to:

	temp = @(2)
	temp.x = 1
	temp.y = 3
	f(temp)
	a = temp

In order to initialize a list, one can use the following syntax:

	fieldlist -> '[' [lfieldlist1 ] ']'
	lfieldlist1 -> exp {',' exp }

As an example:

	a = @["v1", "vv"]

is equivalent to:

	temp = @(2)
	temp[1] = "v1"
	temp[2] = "v2"
	a = temp
	
  As particular cases, the following two expressions are completely equivalent:

	@f{ } @f[ ]

4.5.8 Function Calls

A function call has the following syntax:

	functioncall -> var '(' [explist1] ')'
	explist1 -> {exp1 ','} exp

  Here, var can b e any variable (global, lo cal, indexed, etc) whose value has typ e function or Cfunction . All argument expressions are evaluated b efore the call, from left to right; then the list of arguments is adjusted to the length of the list of parameters (see Section 4.3); finally this list is assigned to the parameters.
  Because a function can return any numb er of results (see Section 4.4.3), the numb er of results must b e adjusted b efore used. If the function is called as an statement (see Section 4.4.4), its return list is adjusted to 0. If the function is called in a place that needs a single value (syntactically denoted by the non-terminal exp1), its return list is adjusted to 1. If the function is called in a place that can hold many values (syntactically denoted by the non-terminal exp), no adjustment is done.


4.6 Function Definitions

Functions in Lua can be defined anywhere in the global level of a module; functions cannot be defined inside other functions. The syntax for function definition is:

	function -> function name '(' [parlist1 ] ')' block end

  When Lua finds a function definition, its body is compiled to intermediate code and stored, with type function, into the global variable name.
  Parameters act as local variables, initialized with the argument values.

	parlist1 -> 'name'{',' name}

  Results are returned using the return statement (see Section 4.4.3). If the control reaches the end of a function without a return instruction, the function returns with no results.

5 The Application Program Interface

This section describes the API for Lua, that is, the set of C functions available to the host program to communicate with the library. The API functions can be classified in the following categories:

	1. executing Lua co de;
	2. converting values between C and Lua;
	3. manipulating (reading and writing) Lua ob jects;
	4. calling Lua functions;
	5. C functions to b e called by Lua;
	6. error handling.

All API functions are declared in the file lua.h. Unless stated otherwise, API functions return an error code: 0 in case of success, non 0 in case of errors.

5.1 Executing Lua Code

A host program can execute Lua programs written in a file or in a string, using the following functions:

int lua_dofile (char *filename);
int lua_dostring (char *string);

5.2 Converting Values between C and Lua

Because Lua has no static typ e system, all values passed b etween Lua and C have type lua_Object, which works like an abstract typ e in C that can hold any Lua value. lua_Object is declared as:

typedef struct Object *lua_Object;

where Object is not declared in lua.h.
  Lua has garbage collection. Therefore, there is no guarantee that a lua_Object will be valid after another execution of Lua co de. A go o d programming practice is to convert such objects to C values as so on as they are available, and never store them in global variables. 
  To check the typ e of a lua_Object, the following functions are available:

	int lua_isnil (lua_Object object);
	int lua_isnumber (lua_Object object);
	int lua_isstring (lua_Object object);
	int lua_istable (lua_Object object);
	int lua_iscfunction (lua_Object object);
	int lua_isuserdata (lua_Object object);

All return 1 if the ob ject has the given typ e, 0 otherwise.
  To translate a value from typ e lua_Object to a specific C type, the programmer can use:

	float lua_getnumber (lua_Object object);
	char *lua_getstring (lua_Object object);
	char *lua_copystring (lua_Object object);
	lua_CFunction lua_getcfunction (lua_Object object);
	void *lua_getuserdata (lua_Object object);

lua_getnumber converts a lua_Object to a float. This lua_Object must b e a numb er or a string convertible to numb er (see Section 4.2); otherwise, the function returns 0.
  lua_getstring converts a lua_Object to a string (char *). This lua_Object must be a string or a number; otherwise, the function returns 0 (the null p ointer). This function does not create a new string, but returns a p ointer to a string inside the Lua environment. Because Lua has garbage collection, there is no guarantee that such p ointer will b e valid after another execution of Lua co de. The function lua_copystring b ehaves exactly like lua_getstring, but returns a fresh copy of the string.
  lua_getcfunction converts a lua_Object to a C function. This lua_Object must have type Cfunction ; otherwise, the function returns 0 (the null p ointer). The type lua_CFunction
is explained in Section 5.5.
  lua_getuserdata converts a lua_Object to void*. This lua_Object must have type userdata ; otherwise, the function returns 0 (the null p ointer). 
  The reverse process, that is, the conversion from a specific C type to the typ e lua_Object, is done by using the following functions:

	int lua_pushnumber (float n);
	int lua_pushstring (char *s);
	int lua_pushcfunction (lua_CFunction f);
	int lua_pushuserdata (void *u);

All of them receive a C value, convert it to a lua_Object, and leave their results on the top of the Lua stack, where it can b e assigned to a variable, passed as paramenter to a Lua function, etc (see below). To complete the set, the value nil or a lua_Object can also be pushed onto the stack, with:

	int lua_pushnil (void);
	int lua_pushobject (lua_Object object);
